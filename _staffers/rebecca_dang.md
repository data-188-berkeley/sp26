about-me: |
    Hey there! I’m a 5th Year MS EECS student and I’m excited to teach DATA 188 for the first time! In the past, I’ve taught DATA C88C and DATA 101. In my free time, I love fangirling over the most recent book/TV show/movie I’m obsessed with, hiking, and playing guitar. Come talk to me about anything :)
office-hours: TBD
