about-me: |
    Hello! I'm Andria, a current junior from the bay area. I'm very excited to be teaching Data 188 this semester! Previously, I've taught Data C88C. I also do research in reinforcement learning! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing board games (hit me up if you want to play a game of connect 4 or chess), and trying random new things. Looking forward to getting to know you all :D
office-hours: TBD
