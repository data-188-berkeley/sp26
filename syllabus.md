IMPORTANT(2026-01-09) This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, and not finalized.


## Technology


### Ed

We will use [Ed](https://TODO/add/link) as the 'one-stop shop' throughout the semester: for a Q&A
forum and for official announcements.

**Enrollment in Ed is mandatory.
It is your responsibility to regularly check Ed for important announcements.**
**Failure to do so may result in severe consequences for your ability to succeed in this course.**

If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Ed
rather than emailing the instructor or TAs. Please do not post anything
resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. If in doubt, you
should make your post private (visible to instructors only). We always welcome
any feedback on what we could be doing better.

To join the class Ed: after you have officially enrolled in the course and are added to the bCourses, you will be automatically added to the course Ed.
If you are not able to access the Ed, please email the course instructors: ekim555@berkeley.edu.

### Gradescope

All homework will be submitted through [Gradescope](https://TODO/add/link), and all grades will be
returned through Gradescope.

To join the class Gradescope: after you have officially enrolled in the course and are added to the bCourses, you will be automatically added to the course Gradescope.
If you are not able to access the Gradescope, please email the course instructors: ekim555@berkeley.edu.

### bCourses

Lecture videos will be available from the [bCourses site](https://TODO/add/link), under the "Media Gallery" section.
We will not use bCourses for any other content.

## Attendance policy

Attendance for lectures/discussions will not be tracked, nor part of your grade.
With that said, we encourage you to attend as much of the course in-person as possible (including attending the Zoom lectures "live"), as we believe consistent active engagement leads to positive outcomes in terms of learning and course grades.

## Exams

There will be one midterm, and a final exam.
Both exams will be on campus, in-person, paper and pencil, and proctored by course staff.

For the midterm, you are allowed one page (double sided) of notes.
For the final exam, you are allowed two pages (double sided) of notes.

The midterm exam date will be: **TBD**.
The final exam date will be: **TBD**.

We will grant alternate midterm and final exam times for only for extenuating circumstances.

## Materials

### Discussions

Discussion worksheets are released the day before the first discussions of the
week. The discussion sections will give you additional practice solving
problems. You may attend whichever, as many, and as few discussion sections you
like.


### Homeworks

There are **4 homeworks** for this class, which are released roughly 3 weeks at a
time.
You will submit your assignments on Gradescope.
Grades will be released on Gradescope.

Doing the homeworks and reading the
solutions is vital for your learning. You are expected to show your work and
justify all of your answers.

Homework and projects will be graded by correctness, typically via Gradescope autograder. There will be unlimited autograder attempts allowed.

Homework late policy: homework assignments have a 24 hour late submission grace period, where students can submit up to 24 hours late without any deduction in points.
However, after this 24 hour grace period, late submissions will not be accepted, and students will instead receive 0 points for the late (25+ hours) assignment).

## Academic Integrity


### Cheating


Ethical behavior is an important part of being an engineer. It is a part of our
responsibility to act ethically and honestly, and moreover, ethical behavior is
what helps you learn best. Cheating is fundamentally dishonest and antisocial
behavior. We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating. Any unconfessed offense
will result in negative points for the category that the offense occurs in, with
no bound on how negative it can go, and a referral to the Center for Student
Conduct.

You are not permitted to upload any of our problems, solutions, or your own
solutions to our problems to any site that is accessible by other people. Use
Ed to discuss content. The only limited exceptions to this are online
communication mediums between you and the collaborating individuals explicitly
listed on your homework assignment. Looking at online solutions from previous
semesters or other students is forbidden, as is sharing of your solutions with
others. Furthermore, students all have an affirmative duty to report possible
cases of cheating or unauthorized communication to the course staff,
immediately. Acknowledgement of and failure to report cheating implicates the
bystander since this is academic misconduct. Cheating hurts us all and
engineering ethics requires us to point out wrongdoing when we are aware of it.

### Collaboration

You are encouraged to collaborate on homeworks with others; however, this
collaboration must be limited to high-level discussion. **All coding must be done
on your own**, and you should not discuss specific solutions or look at another’s
code. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework
problems, but you must always credit all such sources and you must never copy
material verbatim. You must explicitly acknowledge everyone whom you have worked
with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework.


## Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Homework: 25%
- Final Project: 15%
- Midterm Exam: 20%
- Final Exam: 40%

Participation/attendance will not be graded or tracked for lectures/discussions.

Final course grades will be subject to a curve to meet university and departmental guidelines.
